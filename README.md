## Overview: Multilevel models

Multilevel models are extensions of normal linear regression that allow a researcher to model the inherent variability between clusters in a wider population. I have given numerous talks and presentation about this analysis method. I believe it to be the present and future of statistical modelling, and concur with Richard McElreath when he says that it should be the default tool (and researchers should provide strong reasoning why they are choosing to use a different method). Despite my person efforts, the uptake of multilevel models is slow. This is in spite of the vast improvements in computational power that allow Frequentist and Bayesian versions of these models to be fitted with relative computational ease. 

I believe that one reason for the lack of uptake in my current area of work is a lack of formal tutorials. Whilst tutorials exist, they are largely in areas of Ecology, Linguistics, or Edcuation research. This is not surprising, considering that the quantitative data produced in these research areas is naturally hierarchical (e.g., Education: pupils within classes, classes within schools, schools within counties, and so on). These tutorials are fine in and off themselves, and can undoubtedly help people under the models. However, from my own experience, the hurdle is lessened if their is a tutorial that focuses specifically on the area you are working on. In this sense, I am providing the tutorial that I wanted when I first started working on these models back in 2019.  

This repository contains the code that produces the analysis and plots for the larger manuscript. There are things in the code that are not covered in great detail in the manuscript, and vice versa. The two accompany each other.
